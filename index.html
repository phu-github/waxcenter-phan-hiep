                    <p>Your Wax Specialist will ask you to remove your garments from the waist down before hopping on the bed. This allows your specialist to work uninterrupted and also prevents wax from getting on your undergarments or clothing. And hey: don’t be shy – we think you look great!</p>

Everyone's hairs grow in different cycles so it's possible that hairs below the skin's surface are just now sprouting after your wax service.</p>
                    <p  class="c-width-350 sm-width-100p sm-fs-16">Daily moisturizing between services is key, since dry or brittle hair can easily break during a bikini or Brazilian wax service. So just go with the flow and allow these hairs to grow so we can remove them at your next reservation.</p>

It's very dangerous to wax while on accutane and a doctor's note will be needed to receive services.
