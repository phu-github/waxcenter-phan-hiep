                    <p>Your Wax Specialist will ask you to remove your garments from the waist down before hopping on the bed. This allows your specialist to work uninterrupted and also prevents wax from getting on your undergarments or clothing. And hey: don’t be shy – we think you look great!</p>

                    <p class="wrapper__care__grid_des sm-fs-16 c-mb-34 sm-mb-24 c-width-340">After your first bikini wax , every following wax gets easier and easier (as long as you don’t shave!)</p>
                    <p class="wrapper__care__grid_des sm-fs-16 c-width-340">If you shave, the next bikini wax will probably feel just like the first. And shaving between waxes can cause itching, or worse… ingrown hairs. So put down that razor!</p>

                    <p class="c-mb-32 sm-mb-24 sm-fs-16 c-width-350">Sure, sun-kissed skin looks amazing, but you should wait 24 to 48 hours after a wax before hopping out in the sun.</p>
                    <p class="c-width-350 sm-fs-16">Freshly waxed skin is more prone to sun damage if exposed too soon. If you just must go in the sun, be sure to thoroughly apply sunscreen to the waxed area.</p>

                    <p class="c-width-350 sm-fs-16">Our advice is to wait 24 to 48 hours so your skin has time to heal and hair follicles can close. Doing so will prevent any further skin irritation.</p>
